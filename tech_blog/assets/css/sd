This is Sumedha Rani from TYIT.
I wanted to inform you that I approached Principal Mr. Agnelo Menezes with the proposal for Xenith'16 with the help and permission of Prof. Shivaranjani Gudibanda, and Agnelo sir gave his approval for the fest to be held on 8th and 9th of February 2016.
Now that we have got permission for the fest to be held, we would like to form the organising team at the earliest. 
I would like to request your permission to send out emails to all the three classes of our dept inviting applications for the heads and subheads of the different departments. the email IDs of every class student is present with the CR of the class. If you could please give permission to obtain these email ids and send then send them the mails, we could start the application process.
I also wanted to ask you if your permission for sending out mails will suffice or do I have to take permission from Agnelo sir also.
