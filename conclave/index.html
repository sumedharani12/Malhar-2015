After completing her BMM degree from Jai Hind College, Mumbai and a course from Canada, <strong style="color:#FFCC00;">Upasana Makati</strong> took a job at a leading PR firm. But her entrepreneurial drive was not content with just a job. She wanted to set up her own venture. After learning that India is home to the largest population of visually challenged individuals but we do not have any print publications for their leisure, Upasana decided to make that her goal. Three months into her research she decided to quit her job. The result was the birth of White Print - India's first English lifestyle magazine in Braille that covers topics ranging from art, technology, politics, music, short stories and even Bollywood.<br/>

In her endeavor to establish a Braille magazine, Ms.Upasana also revolutionized marketing, by exposing it to avenues that were previously unknown to it. The advertisements in White Print deviate from the usual visual medium to text. Coca-Cola even designed a musical advertisement with the help of a chip in each magazine. From 20 to 300 copies a month. This is just the beginning for White Print and Upasana Makati.<br/> </p>

shunning the well-worn path has not only paid off for <strong style="color:#FFCC00;">Dhruv Lakra</strong>, but has also generated employment
